OVERALL IDEA

A to-do Api

Captures a list of to-do's per person.

Features:
- View a list of to-do's
- View individual to-do
- Can create a to-do
- Can update a to-do 
- Can delete a to-do;
// Can delete a to-do; soft delete

Probably want a seperate endpoint for marking a todo as complete

// IsArchived; boolean, false by default
